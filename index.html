        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>
          I was born and raised in Oregon where I went to high school and took only one 
          computer science class even though I liked the class a lot I never perused it 
          until I got to my second year in college. I came to college thinking I wanted to 
          be a doctor of some sort but after taking classes I came to realize that the medical 
          route was not my passion, I then decided to get back into computer science and 
          programing and ever since then I have never regrated my decision. I like to code 
          I for the most part enjoy the challenge of making something out of nothing.  
          I also enjoy other activities like hiking and finding new places to try in my city.
